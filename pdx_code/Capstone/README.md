Name: Aqua Alliance Site

-Project Overview-
Using Django, HTML/CSS, and Javascript, I am going to make a web page for my mother-in-law’s street’s Water Association. It is similar to a Housing Association, except that they are only concerned with managing the street’s shared well. It will have user login for everyone on the street, but permissions for only the President, Vice-President, and Treasurer to post to a public bulletin board when important news needs to be spread, such as scheduled meetings or when a water line had burst and the street had to limit their water usage.


-Features-

As an administrator, I want to be able to share important news quickly and easily because I want to keep everyone informed.
